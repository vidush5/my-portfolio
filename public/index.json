The demand for Data engineers has risen in recent days. When you google what is data engineering? you can get thousands of answers but here I pointing out only three answers that I understood clearly and I hope that will make you get a clear understanding.\n  Data engineering is the practice of designing and building systems for collecting, storing, and analyzing data at scale.\n  The key to understanding what data engineering lies in the ‚Äúengineering‚Äù part. Engineers design and build things. ‚ÄúData‚Äù engineers design and build pipelines that transform and transport data into a format wherein, by the time it reaches the Data Scientists or other end users, it is in a highly usable state.\n  Data engineering is the complex task of making raw data usable to data scientists and groups within an organization. Data engineering encompasses numerous specialties of data science.\n  In this article, I will mention key terms used by data engineers regularly. I have tried my best to keep this as simple as possible and decided to compile it all in one place.\nKey Terms Data Lineage Data lineage is a process of understanding how the data generated from the source and how it reaches the destination. Simply it answers the following questions.\n Where the data begins? What happens to it over time? Where it moves over time? Where it ends up?  Data Lineage Tools  Keboola Dremio Kylo Octopai  Data Pipeline Sequences of processes/steps that copy, transform, load and analyze the data.\nDAG Data pipelines are modeled as Directed acyclic graphs. DAG is a conceptual representation of a series of activities or in other words, a mathematical abstraction of a data pipeline.\nData Warehouse Exists on top of several databases and used for business intelligence.\nExamples  Google BigQuery Snowflake  Apache Impala Basically, to overcome the slowness of Hive queries, Cloudera offers a seperate tool is what we call Impala.\n Offers high-performance, low-latency SQL queries. Only available in Hadoop distribution. MPP (Massive Parallel Processing) query engine that executes on Hadoop platform.  Apache Kafka Open-source streaming platform.\nOLTP Online Transactional Processing designed for transactional processing, typically follow data normalization rules.\n Transactional Real time fast processing Normalized Examples: Financial transactional systems, ATM Center  OLAP Online Analytical Processing models used for datawarehouse and datamart applications.\n Analytical Slow queries Denormalized Historical data Example: Recommendation Systems  References  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOn-DJbUi1w\u0026amp;t=61s  That‚Äôs it! Happy learning ..! Will update other terms in future!\n","permalink":"https://vidush.netlify.app/blog/vocabulary_for_de/","summary":"Data Engineering Data Engineering is one of the leading \u0026amp; emerging fields.
